#  Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing heart failure based on multiple clinical parameters. The dataset used is heart_failure.csv, which contains various medical attributes related to cardiovascular health.
#🔹 Libraries Used
The project imports the following Python libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data manipulation and numerical operations
matplotlib.pyplot → Data visualization
sklearn.model_selection → Data splitting and cross-validation
sklearn.preprocessing → Data scaling
sklearn.metrics → Model evaluation
sklearn classifiers → Various machine learning models including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Naïve Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
🔹 Results & Conclusion
✅ The project successfully trains a KNN model for heart failure prediction.
✅ The best K value is determined through cross-validation, reducing error rates.
✅ The accuracy score and confusion matrix are used for model performance evaluation.
✅ The approach can be extended by testing other ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees.
🔹 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve feature selection using correlation analysis.
🔹 Implement GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
🔹 Try Deep Learning models like Neural Networks.
🔹 Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications
